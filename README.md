# ArduExoplanet_Plotter

ArduExoplanet Plotter is a program designed to monitor and visualize in real-time data from a photoresistor connected to a microcontroller such as Arduino. The goal is to simulate photometry experiments used in the observation of exoplanets.

## Key Features

- **Real-time plotting** of photoresistor data.
- **Data logging** to a file.
- **Dynamic adjustment** of plot update speed.
- **Graph screenshot** directly from the interface.
- Compatibility with various serial ports and baud rates.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Arduino or another microcontroller configured to send photoresistor data via a serial port

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ArduExoplanet.git
cd ArduExoplanet
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**

   Ensure the dependencies are installed. If not, use the command above.

3. **Prepare Arduino**

   Upload a sketch to Arduino that sends photoresistor data via the serial port.

4. **Run the Program**

   Launch the program with:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Connect your Arduino (or another microcontroller) to your PC.
2. Select the correct serial port and baud rate from the interface.
3. Press "Start" to begin receiving and plotting data.
4. Use the buttons to:
   - **Save data** to a log file
   - **Reset the graph**
   - **Save a screenshot** of the graph
   - **Update the plot speed**
